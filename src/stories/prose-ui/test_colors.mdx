# Test Colors

<h1 id="heading-title-text">
  Primary colors
</h1>

Our primary color palette is designed for use throughout our digital products within interfaces and for branding. Primary colors are displayed most frequently across our products' screens and components.

 

Primary colors are used for:

- Key actions such as primary call to action buttons

- Highlighted content

- Form field elements

 

We chose colors that offer a range of uses and that meet or exceed standards in supporting accessibility and contrast for low vision users. The guidelines indicate how colors should be applied, noting where some should be utilized sparingly and with purpose for specific components like errors or messaging.
